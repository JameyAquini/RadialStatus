# radialStatus Theme for Vencord

A minimal UI tweak for radialStatus in Discord using Vencord. Subtle, clean, and created by me.

Installation

Download the .css file from this page.

Open Discord with Vencord installed.

Go to Vencord Settings → Themes → Open Theme Folder.

Move the downloaded .css file into the folder.

Toggle the theme ON in Vencord.

Notes:

[!NOTE]
This theme only makes a small UI change to radialStatus. Nothing major will be affected.

[!CAUTION]
Make sure your Vencord is up-to-date. Older versions might not support the theme fully.

[!IMPORTANT]
Refresh Discord if the theme does not appear immediately after uploading.

[!TIP]
You can tweak the .css file if you want to customize colors or sizing further.
